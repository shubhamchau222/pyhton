# practice for file handling : PRACTICE FOR FILE HANDLING                                       DATE:- 02/02/2020
# THIS FILE INCLUDES ( READ, WRIITE , DELETE , CREATE ) modes & DELETE MODE also

# to open file formulae is  f= open( "file path.txt", "mode")
#formulae for read this file is  print( file variable .read())
